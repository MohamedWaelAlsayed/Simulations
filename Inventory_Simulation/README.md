# Inventory_Simulation

Made a simulation for Resumed shortage Inventory

This code is a simulation of an inventory system. It takes in a list of leads, their probabilities and a random number, then maps it to lead time. It also takes in a list of demands, their probabilities and a random number, then maps it to demand time. It also takes in the standard inventory level, periodic review length, number of cycles, start quantity and added quantity.

The code then runs through the simulation for the given number of cycles and calculates the average end of inventory as well as the number of shortage times out of the total days.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)

libraries: numpy

This code was a task in Simulations course (Semster 7 Fall 2022) in Faculty of computers and data science, Alexandria University
